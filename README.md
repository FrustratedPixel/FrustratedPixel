## ðŸ‘‹ Hello there lurkers! Shiva here.

I'm a supposed to be Mechanical Engineer getting into the world of Machine Learning and AI. Only because I find it really interesting and *totally* not because of the money or anything, aye. I enjoy building projects that make use of the latest developments in technology and constantly try to learn everything my eyes can catch, just so I don't end up becoming a boomer LoL.

- Currently exploring Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), LangChain, and Graph Neural Networks.  
- Learning (or trying to atleast) about the logic and math behind the recently booming LLMs and Transformers.
- In my free time, I love playing indie video games (yâ€™all should totally try *Disco Elysium*) and learning about new advancements in all sorts of technology be it phones, laptops, or even refrigerators.
